                                                Stimulating the release of happy hormones: Chocolate, especially dark
                                                chocolate, contains compounds that stimulate the
                                                release of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which are the hormones

                                                psychological comfort. Consuming chocolate also contributes to improving

                                                stress. Eating a piece of chocolate during stressful times gives the

                                                Chocolate is considered one of the foods that leave a positive impact on
                                                individuals’ mental and emotional states.
                                                Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains chemical compounds that
                                                help improve mood, such as serotonin and
                                                dopamine, which are neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of
                                                happiness and comfort. When consuming chocolate, the
                                                brain releases the hormone endorphin, known as the "happiness hormone,"
                                                which helps reduce stress and anxiety.

                                                energy boost. It is also believed that the flavonoids found in cocoa
                                                contribute to improving brain function and

                                                happiness and psychological comfort. However, it is recommended to

                                                Choose dark chocolate: Dark chocolate contains a high percentage of

                                                Focus on the cocoa percentage: It is preferable to choose chocolate that
